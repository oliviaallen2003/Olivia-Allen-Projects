## Datasets

Tinder data for top 7 users in 2020 collected from [Swipestats.io](https://www.swipestats.io/).

- `users_top7_2020.csv`

The column names contain prefixes "matches", "likes", and "passes" followed by a number; the suffix number represents the month; and the cell represents either the total number of matches (matches), total number of times the user swiped right (likes), or total number of times the user swiped left (passes) during that month (ie: `matches_1` = total number of matches during January 2020).
