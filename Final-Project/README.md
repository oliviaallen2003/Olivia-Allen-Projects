# Spotify Song Data Analysis Project

# Overview 
This repository contains files and scripts I created for my final project for Data Science with R (Statistics 301). My project analyzes the relationships between various song attributes such as tempo, danceability, song title length and artist name length and how they relate to song popularity.
